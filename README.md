THE LOGIC BEHINDS
-----------------
The algorithms puts in a number and checks if it is valid for the row, column, and the smaller 3*3 box, and moves to the next empty box
When it comes across a situation when it cannot put a valid number then it backtracks to previous filled spot and tries to look for another number. 
However this is better approach than Brute force approach
